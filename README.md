# messenger-web-dark

This is a single-line extension:
  `document.getElementById("facebook").classList.add("__fb-dark-mode");`
  
Messenger Web already has built in support for a dark mode, but no actual setting anywhere to turn it on. This extension runs the line above anytime a Messenger tab is loaded, enabling the "secret" dark mode.
